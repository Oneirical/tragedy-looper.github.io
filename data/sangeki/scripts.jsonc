If the Protagonists are able to crack the gimmick, the Mastermind has no way to win other than exposing the :timeTraveler:. There are only three candidates (::alien::, :blackCat:, and :classRep:), and since there's time to kill them with the :hospitalIncident: or via the ::alien::, or accumulating ::goodwill:: on the third Day, they'll be revealed pretty quickly.\n\nBy the way, the title and \\\"AI\\\" (\\\"love\\\") are puns.

It takes some effort for the Protagonists to stop this, so it's impossible for them to immediately clear the game in the early Loops.\n\nFirst, scatter ::paranoia:: in the early game and move to cause all three Incidents.

At the same time, stack ::intrigue:: on the :littleSister: and sime for a CS with :signWithMe:. It's relatively easy to stop ::intrigue:: on the :littleSister:, so the CS ov :signWithMe: will collapse at that point.

It will be difficult to differentiate between the ::brain:: and the ::cultist::.\n\nThere are ways to reveal both, but they're complete gimmicks, so the Protagonists' imaginations will be tested. Please refer to the steps below.\n\nThe most important point is that the Protagonists kill the two ::friend::s. The key to exposing the :conspiracyTheorist: is the characteristic of the :sacred:tree::. If you give the :sacred:tree:: and the ::alien:: ::goodwill::+1 and the Loop starts, you can use ::alien::'s ::goodwill:: ability on the first Day. If you kill the ::hench:man::: with that, the Mastermind will have no choice but to reveal the :conspiracyTheorist:.\n\nAs for the ::brain:: and ::cultist::, you can crack the ::cultist:: by killing the ::patient::, who is the Culprit on the third Day, with ::alien::'s :man:datory ability. If you put all your ::goodwill:: into the :littleSister: and ::alien::, you can activate the ::doctor::'s ::goodwill:: ability via the :littleSister: on the second Day, and have the ::alien:: kill the ::patient:: on the third Day. In that case, the Mastermind can't win unless he uses the ::cultist::'s ability. However, as soon as he does that, the Protagonists are guaranteed a victory in the Final Guess."

      "story": "There are no butterflies here yet, just insects slithering on the ground dreaming of becoming butterflies.",
      "mastermindHints": "On the first Day, put Forbid ::goodwill:: on the :partTimer:, ::paranoia::+1 on the :classRep:, ::intrigue::+2 on the School, and use the ::teacher::'s :conspiracyTheorist: ability. Move the ::girl::student::, and even if the School has Forbid ::intrigue::, activate it on the ::teacher:: herself (even if the ::factor:: disguise has failed). If it's known that the ::teacher:: is not a ::factor::, it becomes a multiple choice question.\nIs ::paranoia::+1 on the ::teacher:: a good idea?\n\nThe second Day branches based on the first Day actions. If the ::teacher:: does not have two ::paranoia::, place ::paranoia::+1, otherwise leave her alone. \n\n::paranoia::+1 on the :classRep: is a :man:datory.\nIf ::paranoia:: is 1 on a :partTimer:, place Forbid Paranoid. If the ::paranoia:: is 0, it's a free action. You can also place Forbid ::goodwill::. As a free action, if ::intrigue:: is not on the School, you can place 1 ::intrigue:: on the school (it'll be tricky if they know that the ::teacher:: is the :conspiracyTheorist:, and not the ::factor::). \n\nIf you don't have enough ::paranoia::, trigger ::teacher::'s :conspiracyTheorist: and get a guaranteed ::spreading:: Incident. The first thing to do is to remove the :partTimer:'s ::goodwill::, and the second thing is to remove the ::teacher::'s ::goodwill::.  If there's a ::goodwill:: Ban for the :partTimer:, the ::teacher::'s ::goodwill:: should be included.\n\nIt might be a good idea to place ::goodwill:: on the :officeWorker:. It's important to not unnecessarily reduce the number of :timeTraveler: candidates. This will allow the :partTimer: to have 0 ::goodwill:: on the third Day, which means the ::paranoia:: counter will only go up to 1 no matter what happens.\n\nBranching will occur dependong on the number of ::paranoia:: counters. On the third Day, if the :partTimer: has 1 ::paranoia::, place a Forbid ::goodwill::. If you're confident that you can win the read, place a Forbid ::paranoia::. If the ::paranoia:: is at 0, then place a Move, ::intrigue::+1, or ::paranoia::+1.\n\nNow's the time for you to strike.\n\n:classRep: gets ::paranoia::+1. \nThe School gets ::intrigue::+1, or Forbid ::goodwill::, or the ::teacher:: aims to join up with the :classRep:, or the ::teacher:: aims to join up with the :partTimer:. Combine these actions.\n\nTo summarize, just be careful not to let your counters reach three in this situation. Since you're surrounded by the :conspiracyTheorist:, ::factor::, and ::cultist::, it's best to keep it at one or two counters.\n\nOn the 4th Day, though, aim for triggering :increasing:paranoia:: and make the :partTimer: to self-destruct at the end of the turn. Use a ::paranoia::+1 on :classRep:, ::intrigue:: or ::paranoia::+1 on the :partTimer:, activate :conspiracyTheorist:, and so on to aim for self-destruction.\n\n:classRep:'s :increasing:paranoia:: won't occur if the ::teacher:: escapes and ::paranoia::-1 is placed three times, but since they'll think \\\":classRep: has used all of the ::paranoia::-1, so the Protagonists ::paranoia::-1 won't be used,\\\" the Mastermind's ::paranoia::+1 on the 4th Day will definitely go through. Therefore, if you reach the 3rd Day with two counters, you're guaranteed a win.\n\nOn the 5th Day, just place Forbid ::goodwill:: and Move. You should be guaranteed a win, so try to win.\n\nOn the other hand, if the :partTimer: doesn't self-destruct, or self-destructs on the 3rd Day, you're guaranteed to lose.\n\nIf the ::informer::'s ::goodwill:: ability is activated, respond appropriately. I think it's best to answer with :unsettlingRumor:."

",
      "story": "",
      "mastermindHints": "Up until the third loop, the scriptwriter's means of victory are strictly defined. By following this, you can make the protagonist feel :despair: with each loop.\n\n-1st loop: ::murder:: of ::friend:: by :serial:killer::\n\n-2nd loop: ::suicide:: of :key:person::\n\n-3rd loop onwards: PP1 with :faraway:murder:: The 2nd loop is preparation time. By following the template, you can set up a vicious PP from the 3rd loop onwards. However, if you do not place a ::goodwill:: counter on the :officeWorker: in the 1st loop, the script will fall apart. Keep placing Forbid ::goodwill:: on the ::boss:: and encourage the :officeWorker: to use his ability. The 3rd loop is where the real action begins. From this point onwards, keep placing Forbid ::goodwill:: on the :ai: and ::paranoia::+1 on the ::journalist:: every day to cause :increasing:paranoia::. Put that ::paranoia:: on :transfer:student:: and ::intrigue:: on the :officeWorker:. By following the template the next day, you can be sure to win with :faraway:murder::. Note that you don't have to place ::intrigue:: on the ::journalist:: and :officeWorker: on the 4th day. If the ::journalist:: doesn't have ::paranoia::-1, prepare ::intrigue:: the next day. By doing so, you can place Forbid ::goodwill:: on the :ai: on the 4th day as well. Aim for ::spreading:: to occur on the 4th loop. If ::spreading:: occurs after the 4th loop, you can prevent the :officeWorker: from padding their ::goodwill:: and losing the chance to escape the loop. Hide the ::killer:: in the final battle. Do not refuse the ::boss::'s ::goodwill:: ability.\n\nThe way for the protagonist to win is to cause ::spreading:: with the :ai: and remove the ::goodwill:: counter from the ::journalist::. The steps to do this are as follows.\n\nFirst, place ::paranoia::-1 on the ::journalist:: until the 2nd day, and place 3 ::goodwill:: on :rich:student::.\n\nThen, on the third day, make sure :rich:student:: is not in the Shrine, and if there is a card on :transfer:student::, put ::paranoia::-1 on it. During this time, the :officeWorker: must not have ::intrigue::, so keep Forbid ::intrigue:: on it until the third day. However, if the :officeWorker: is free, try ::goodwill::+1 on the :ai:\n\nThen the writer must follow the template for the fourth day, and the :ai: and :rich:student:: will be free, so the :ai:'s ::goodwill:: ability can be used all at once.\n\nNote that you can take care of ::spreading:: by putting Forbid ::intrigue:: on the ::journalist:: here. Thus, by removing the ::goodwill:: counter from the ::journalist:: here, you can almost certainly seal :increasing:paranoia:: in the next loop.\n\nIf you get this far, the protagonist's victory is almost certain.\n\nFirst Loop\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    ::boss::\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    Shrine\n    「::intrigue::+1」\n\nDay 2\n\n\n    :officeWorker:\n    「Vertical Movement」\n    ::boss::\n    「Horizontal Movement」\n    \nDay 3\n\n\n    ::boss::\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n\nDay 4\n\n\n    ::boss::\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n\nDay 5\n\n\n    ::boss::\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    \n2nd Loop\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :officeWorker:\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :ai:\n    「Diagonal Movement」\n    Shrine\n    「::intrigue::+2」\n    \n3rd Loop\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「::intrigue::+1」\n    \nDay 2\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :rich:student::\n    「Vertical Movement」\n\nDay 3\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :transfer:student::\n    「Vertical Movement」\n\nDay 4\n\n\n    :transfer:student::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「::intrigue::+1」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::intrigue::+2」\n\n4th Loop (if the :breakthrough: is discovered)\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    Rich ::man::'s Daughter\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n\nDay 2\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :rich:student::\n    「Vertical Movement」\n\nDay 3\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid ::goodwill::」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :transfer:student::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\nDay 4\n\n\n    :transfer:student::\n    「::paranoia::+1」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「::intrigue::+1」\n    ::journalist::\n    「::intrigue::+2」\n\n\n\nProtagonists' winning strategy (not Mastermind's strategy)\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::-1」\n    :rich:student::\n    「::goodwill::+2」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「Forbid ::intrigue::」\n\nDay 2\n\n\n    ::journalist::\n    「::paranoia::-1」\n    :rich:student::\n    「::goodwill::+1」\n\nDay 3\n\n\n    :transfer:student::\n    「::paranoia::-1」\n    :classRep:\n    「::goodwill::+2」\n    :rich:student::\n    「Move to City」\n\nDay 4\n\n\n    ::journalist::\n    「::intrigue::Forbid」\n    :ai:\n    「::goodwill::+2」\n    :rich:student::\n    「Move to City」"

We recommend that you keep your communication with the Protagonists to a minimum except for answering their questions, and leave your seat between Loops.\n\nWhen the Public Sheet is presented, the Protagonists may laugh at the limitations on the Mastermind, but they won't be laughing much longer.\n\nBasically, aim for ::spreading:: and :hospitalIncident: to occur, and for ::immortal:: to take effect by involving :godlyBeing:. Move ::doctor:: to City (preparing for ::goodwill:: and ::paranoia:: boost), and keep placing ::paranoia:: on :forensicSpecialist: and ::boss::. Move :blackCat: to Hospital, and at the same time, place ::intrigue:: +2 on Hospital. \n\nAlthough the Protagonists will initially see this as a normal power play and try to thwart it, you should make full use of the abilities of the :conspiracyTheorist: and ::cultist::.\n\nIn the unlikely event that ::spreading:: does occur, remove it from :rich:student:: and place it on ::doctor::, :godlyBeing:, or :forensicSpecialist:.\n\nIf you have extra hands, place Forbid ::goodwill:: on :rich:student:: or move it to the City (so that you can use :forensicSpecialist: to remove it if ::goodwill:: is placed). The Protagonists will probably not understand your intentions, and a spiteful Protagonist who is used to the game will sneak through and place ::paranoia:: or ::goodwill:: on it, not realizing that they're tying their own noose.\n\nWhen the Culprit behind :butterflyEffect: and role of the :godlyBeing: are revealed, the Protagonists will feel the difficulty of breaking the loop, and the strange discomfort caused by the Mastermind's actions. Once they realize the true purpose behind everything, it's time for telepathic cooperation. Let's break out of this ac:curse:d Loop, together.\n\nTo break the loop, you need to do the following 4 things:\n\n- Cause a :hospitalIncident:\n\n- Move the ::patient:: out of the Hospital before the Incident occurs\n\n- Involve the :blackCat: in the :hospitalIncident:\n\n- Place 3 ::goodwill:: on :godlyBeing:\n\nThere are two routes: use :godlyBeing: to remove one ::intrigue:: from the Hospital, or use the ::soldier:: to make the Protagonists ::immortal::.\n\nIf the role of :rich:student:: is exposed due to the whims of the Protagonists, it will be more difficult to break through the Loop. In that case, on the first day, place a Vertical Movement on ::doctor::, a Horizontal Movement on :rich:student::, and a ::paranoia:: +1 on :forensicSpecialist: or ::boss:: to support them.\n\nIn any case, if the Protagonists and Mastermind work together perfectly, at the end of the last day:\n\n- All characters except :blackCat: will survive and gather in the City\n- All ::paranoia:: counters will be zero\n- Everyone will have ::goodwill:: counters on them\n\nYou can do it.

      "mastermindHints": "The scriptwriter's means of victory are killing :sealedItem: and ::friend::. However, since the use of ::paranoia:Virus: is essential to killing ::friend::, we will first aim to win with :sealedItem:.\n\nIn the case of CS axis, CS of the main plot is very important.\n\nPut ::intrigue:: on boards other than City and ::alien:: to expand the possibilities of the main plot. For that, incidents are a strong support. Since you want to cause all incidents while concealing the culprit, scatter ::paranoia:: with all your might. You can also use :conspiracyTheorist: from the beginning. Be careful of the movement of the :policeOfficer: so that you do not narrow down the culprit of :foulEvil:.\n\nIn the case of PP axis, use ::cultist:: to win the first loop. If you pass ::intrigue:: to Shrine, it is better not to cause :foulEvil:. The first loop is very stable, but since you want to hide the ::cultist:: until the final battle, you need to move in such a way that the ::alien::'s ::goodwill:: ability is never used. Use Forbid ::goodwill:: at full power, but be careful of :rich:student:: and :forensicSpecialist:'s ::goodwill:: abilities.\n\nAs the game progresses, it becomes more difficult to win with :sealedItem:. Then it's time to use ::paranoia:Virus:.\n\nOn the final day, leave the ::person:: and ::friend:: alone and aim for a surprise attack by turning them into a :serial:killer:: with :increasing:paranoia::. If the :person: has one ::paranoia:: counter on them, they can be a candidate, so it is important to spread ::paranoia::.\n\nIn the final battle, hide the ::cultist::. It is a role that is difficult to find, but it may be revealed by ::nurse::'s trait, ::paranoia:Virus:, :forensicSpecialist:, etc."
