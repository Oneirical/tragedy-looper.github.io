The :henchman: is the Culprit of the :hospitalIncident:, and the :informer: is a :conspiracyTheorist:, so you can definitely cause a :hospitalIncident:. Normally, the :patient: can only move on the third Day, so if you put :intrigue: on the Hospital with :unsettlingRumor:, you can quickly kill the :patient: (:friend:) and win.\n\nTo survive the :hospitalIncident:, the Protagonists need the power of the :ai: After killing the :ai: (with a :man:datory Ability or an Incident), use :goodwill:+2 on the :ai: and :goodwill:+1 on the :doctor: in the Loop, which will trigger :spreading: and put the :ai:'s :goodwill: on the :doctor:. Then, you can use the :doctor:'s :goodwill: 3 ability on the first Day, allowing the :patient: to escape (:henchman: can't be used here because his ability ignores :goodwill:).\n\nIf you trigger :unsettlingRumor: with the :informer:, you'll get :circle:friend:s: in return, so you will expose the second :friend:.\n\nFinal Guess:\nThis will depend on whether you cleared the Hospital gimmick. If the :ai:'s :friend: has not been revealed, there's no difference between it and the :conspiracyTheorist:, and the Main Plot can't be determined, so you're safe. If the Protagonists are able to crack the gimmick, the Mastermind has no way to win other than exposing the :timeTraveler:. There are only three candidates (:alien:, :blackCat:, and :classRep:), and since there's time to kill them with the :hospitalIncident: or via the :alien:, or accumulating :goodwill: on the third Day, they'll be revealed pretty quickly.\n\nBy the way, the title and \\\"AI\\\" (\\\"love\\\") are puns.

Once the :keyPerson: is revealed, the main plot \\\":lightAvenger:\\\" will be negated, so keep in mind that you don't need to worry about the Shrine's :intrigue:.\n\nWinning via :murder: is done by placing Forbid Movement or :paranoia:+1 on the :popIdol:, and the School's :intrigue: is handled by using Forbid :intrigue:.

However, if the :cultist: is revealed, the Protagonists will interfere and make placing :intrigue: on the School difficult.\n\nThe best resistance the Mastermind can offer on Day 1 is probably School :intrigue:+2 with the :henchman:, placing Horizontal Movement on the :popIdol:, and :paranoia:+1 on the Rich :man:'s Daughter. Although, this can be overcome by moving the :serialKiller: and the :cultist: to the same place.\n\nThe final Loop will be a guessing game. Ideally, you don't want to narrow down the :cultist: candidates, but if there are multiple Forbid moves active, it'll be difficult for the Mastermind to win.

Place :paranoia:+1 on the :soldier:, :intrigue:+2 on the Hospital,and :intrigue:+1 on the School. You can use the :cultist:'s mandatory ability as much as you want. Combined with the :soldier:'s :missingPerson: Incident on the second Day, you can put :intrigue: on the School. If the School's :intrigue: is blocked, trigger a :hospitalIncident: instead to win.

The Protagonists will also notice the :cultist:s and realize that Forbid :intrigue: on the Hospital is useless.\n\nThe :shrineMaiden:'s :suicide: is easily prevent, but thanks to the :cultist:s and the Rich :man:'s Daughter, you can easily win via :hospitalIncident:. Use the :conspiracyTheorist: to increase the number of :hospitalIncident: Culprit candidates as much as possible.\n\nThe way for the Protagonists to escape the Loop is to:\n1. Kill Rich :man:'s Daughter with the :alien:'s mandatory, or\n2. become :immortal: with the :soldier:'s mandatory. \nHowever, 1 requires identifying the :hospitalIncident:'s Culprit. 2 does not require revealing that Culprit, but in order to avoid involving the :soldier: in the :hospitalIncident:, it's necessary to use the :doctor: and :soldier:'s abilities to take advantage of :missingPerson:, or to secure one move by using the :friend:'s :goodwill: 1 mandatory. As the Mastermind, you should crush anyone who gives easy answers such as \\\"Use the :soldier: for an easy victory LOL.\\\"\n\nFor a brute force solution, it's also possible to win by using :paranoia:-1 on the Rich :man:'s Daughter for three days straight. The quickest solution for the Protagonists is to use :alien: and :paranoia:-1 to shut down the :hospitalIncident: Culprit candidates.\n\nAs a Mastermind, this is a bit annoying, but since I created this with the intent of it being a smooth :firstSteps: script, I consider this a correct solution."

Be careful.\n\nDeciding on whether to use the :doctor:'s Ability depends mainly on how much information the Protagonists have acquired, but generally it's better to hide him.\n\nIn :basicTragedy:, the only role from a Sub-Plot that has :goodwill: Refusel is the :factor:.\n　・The :popIdol: is revealed because of :goodwill: Refusel.\n　・The Loop ends with two :intrigue: in the City.\nIn this case, it's better not to use the :doctor: since it might hint at the Main Plot \\\":giantTimeBomb:.\\\" On the other hand, if the :intrigue: onto City isn't successful, Refusel may be a better option here since it gives you two options for :cultist:s.\n\nHowever, it's easier to win if you hide your :brain: amongst the :person:s, so you might as well use it when you don't want the :doctor: to use his :man:datory ability.\n\n3rd Loop\nUse :transferStudent:'s :missingPerson: and :unsettlingRumor: to go for the win. However, you should avoid using :unsettlingRumor: up to this point.\n\nIf you hint at placing :intrigue:+1 on the Shrine and :intrigue:+2 on the Hospital in the previous Loop, you can snatch a victory with :unsettlingRumor:. Just be wary of the :shrineMaiden:'s :goodwill: ability.\n\n4th Loop\nMost of the roles will have been exposed by now, but try to hide the :brain: and the :conspiracyTheorist:. If the Protagonists get the optimal solution at this point, you won't be able to win, so in the end you should aim for a :serialKiller: strike or the :brain:/:cultist:'s mandatory ability.\n\nThe Protagonists can win by:\n\nPlaving Forbid :intrigue: on the Shrine, :paranoia:-1 on :classRep: and :transferStudent:, and not meeting up with the :conspiracyTheorist: (or by using :goodwill:+2 so it doesn't matter if they do).\n\nAnd finally, locking the movement of the :brain: and the :cultist:, and preventing the :serialKiller: from killing your friends."

By setting the initial placement of your :henchman: to the Hospital, you can ensure :increasingUnease:, so place :paranoia: on the :patient:.\n\n:missingPerson: will delay the discovery of the :serialKiller:. At the same time, stack :intrigue: on the :littleSisterKeyword: and sime for a CS with Sign With Me!.

It will be difficult to differentiate between the :brain: and the :cultist:.\n\nThere are ways to reveal both, but they're complete gimmicks, so the Protagonists' imaginations will be tested. Please refer to the steps below.\n\nThe most important point is that the Protagonists kill the two :friend:s. The key to exposing the :conspiracyTheorist: is the characteristic of the :sacredTree:. If you give the :sacredTree: and the :alien: :goodwill:+1 and the Loop starts, you can use :alien:'s :goodwill: ability on the first Day. If you kill the :henchman: with that, the Mastermind will have no choice but to reveal the :conspiracyTheorist:.\n\nAs for the :brain: and :cultist:, you can crack the :cultist: by killing the :patient:, who is the Culprit on the third Day, with :alien:'s mandatory ability. If you put all your :goodwill: into the :littleSisterKeyword: and :alien:, you can activate the :doctor:'s :goodwill: ability via the :littleSisterKeyword: on the second Day, and have the :alien: kill the :patient: on the third Day. In that case, the Mastermind can't win unless he uses the :cultist:'s ability. However, as soon as he does that, the Protagonists are guaranteed a victory in the Final Guess."

      "mastermindHints": "On the first Day, put Forbid :goodwill: on the :partTimer:, :paranoia:+1 on the :classRep:, :intrigue:+2 on the School, and use the :teacher:'s :conspiracyTheorist: ability. Move the :girlStudent:, and even if the School has Forbid :intrigue:, activate it on the :teacher: herself (even if the :factor: disguise has failed). If it's known that the :teacher: is not a :factor:, it becomes a multiple choice question.\nIs :paranoia:+1 on the :teacher: a good idea?\n\nThe second Day branches based on the first Day actions. If the :teacher: does not have two :paranoia:, place :paranoia:+1, otherwise leave her alone. \n\n:paranoia:+1 on the :classRep: is a mandatory.\nIf :paranoia: is 1 on a :partTimer:, place Forbid Paranoid. If the :paranoia: is 0, it's a free action. You can also place Forbid :goodwill:. As a free action, if :intrigue: is not on the School, you can place 1 :intrigue: on the school (it'll be tricky if they know that the :teacher: is the :conspiracyTheorist:, and not the :factor:). \n\nIf you don't have enough :paranoia:, trigger :teacher:'s :conspiracyTheorist: and get a guaranteed :spreading: Incident. The first thing to do is to remove the :partTimer:'s :goodwill:, and the second thing is to remove the :teacher:'s :goodwill:.  If there's a :goodwill: Ban for the :partTimer:, the :teacher:'s :goodwill: should be included.\n\nIt might be a good idea to place :goodwill: on the :officeWorker:. It's important to not unnecessarily reduce the number of :timeTraveler: candidates. This will allow the :partTimer: to have 0 :goodwill: on the third Day, which means the :paranoia: counter will only go up to 1 no matter what happens.\n\nBranching will occur dependong on the number of :paranoia: counters. On the third Day, if the :partTimer: has 1 :paranoia:, place a Forbid :goodwill:. If you're confident that you can win the read, place a Forbid :paranoia:. If the :paranoia: is at 0, then place a Move, :intrigue:+1, or :paranoia:+1.\n\nNow's the time for you to strike.\n\n:classRep: gets :paranoia:+1. \nThe School gets :intrigue:+1, or Forbid :goodwill:, or the :teacher: aims to join up with the :classRep:, or the :teacher: aims to join up with the :partTimer:. Combine these actions.\n\nTo summarize, just be careful not to let your counters reach three in this situation. Since you're surrounded by the :conspiracyTheorist:, :factor:, and :cultist:, it's best to keep it at one or two counters.\n\nOn the 4th Day, though, aim for triggering :increasingUnease: and make the :partTimer: to self-destruct at the end of the turn. Use a :paranoia:+1 on :classRep:, :intrigue: or :paranoia:+1 on the :partTimer:, activate :conspiracyTheorist:, and so on to aim for self-destruction.\n\n:classRep:'s :increasingUnease: won't occur if the :teacher: escapes and :paranoia:-1 is placed three times, but since they'll think \\\":classRep: has used all of the :paranoia:-1, so the Protagonists :paranoia:-1 won't be used,\\\" the Mastermind's :paranoia:+1 on the 4th Day will definitely go through. Therefore, if you reach the 3rd Day with two counters, you're guaranteed a win.\n\nOn the 5th Day, just place Forbid :goodwill: and Move. You should be guaranteed a win, so try to win.\n\nOn the other hand, if the :partTimer: doesn't self-destruct, or self-destructs on the 3rd Day, you're guaranteed to lose.\n\nIf the :informer:'s :goodwill: ability is activated, respond appropriately. I think it's best to answer with :unsettlingRumor:."

",
      "story": "",
      "mastermindHints": "Up until the third loop, the scriptwriter's means of victory are strictly defined. By following this, you can make the protagonist feel despair with each loop.\n\n-1st loop: :murder: of :friend: by :serialKiller:\n\n-2nd loop: :suicide: of :keyPerson:\n\n-3rd loop onwards: PP1 with :farawayMurder: The 2nd loop is preparation time. By following the template, you can set up a vicious PP from the 3rd loop onwards. However, if you do not place a :goodwill: counter on the :officeWorker: in the 1st loop, the script will fall apart. Keep placing Forbid :goodwill: on the :boss: and encourage the :officeWorker: to use his ability. The 3rd loop is where the real action begins. From this point onwards, keep placing Forbid :goodwill: on the :ai: and :paranoia:+1 on the :journalist: every day to cause :increasingUnease:. Put that :paranoia: on :transferStudent: and :intrigue: on the :officeWorker:. By following the template the next day, you can be sure to win with :farawayMurder:. Note that you don't have to place :intrigue: on the :journalist: and :officeWorker: on the 4th day. If the :journalist: doesn't have :paranoia:-1, prepare :intrigue: the next day. By doing so, you can place Forbid :goodwill: on the :ai: on the 4th day as well. Aim for :spreading: to occur on the 4th loop. If :spreading: occurs after the 4th loop, you can prevent the :officeWorker: from padding their :goodwill: and losing the chance to escape the loop. Hide the :killer: in the final battle. Do not refuse the :boss:'s :goodwill: ability.\n\nThe way for the protagonist to win is to cause :spreading: with the :ai: and remove the :goodwill: counter from the :journalist:. The steps to do this are as follows.\n\nFirst, place :paranoia:-1 on the :journalist: until the 2nd day, and place 3 :goodwill: on :richStudent:.\n\nThen, on the third day, make sure :richStudent: is not in the Shrine, and if there is a card on :transferStudent:, put :paranoia:-1 on it. During this time, the :officeWorker: must not have :intrigue:, so keep Forbid :intrigue: on it until the third day. However, if the :officeWorker: is free, try :goodwill:+1 on the :ai:\n\nThen the writer must follow the template for the fourth day, and the :ai: and :richStudent: will be free, so the :ai:'s :goodwill: ability can be used all at once.\n\nNote that you can take care of :spreading: by putting Forbid :intrigue: on the :journalist: here. Thus, by removing the :goodwill: counter from the :journalist: here, you can almost certainly seal :increasingUnease: in the next loop.\n\nIf you get this far, the protagonist's victory is almost certain.\n\nFirst Loop\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :boss:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    Shrine\n    「:intrigue:+1」\n\nDay 2\n\n\n    :officeWorker:\n    「Vertical Movement」\n    :boss:\n    「Horizontal Movement」\n    \nDay 3\n\n\n    :boss:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n\nDay 4\n\n\n    :boss:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n\nDay 5\n\n\n    :boss:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    \n2nd Loop\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :officeWorker:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :ai:\n    「Diagonal Movement」\n    Shrine\n    「:intrigue:+2」\n    \n3rd Loop\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「:intrigue:+1」\n    \nDay 2\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :richStudent:\n    「Vertical Movement」\n\nDay 3\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :transferStudent:\n    「Vertical Movement」\n\nDay 4\n\n\n    :transferStudent:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「:intrigue:+1」\n    :journalist:\n    「:intrigue:+2」\n\n4th Loop (if the breakthrough is discovered)\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    Rich :man:'s Daughter\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n\nDay 2\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :richStudent:\n    「Vertical Movement」\n\nDay 3\n\n\n    :ai:\n    「Forbid :goodwill:」\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :transferStudent:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\nDay 4\n\n\n    :transferStudent:\n    「:paranoia:+1」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「:intrigue:+1」\n    :journalist:\n    「:intrigue:+2」\n\n\n\nProtagonists' winning strategy (not Mastermind's strategy)\n\nDay 1\n\n\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:-1」\n    :richStudent:\n    「:goodwill:+2」\n    :officeWorker:\n    「Forbid :intrigue:」\n\nDay 2\n\n\n    :journalist:\n    「:paranoia:-1」\n    :richStudent:\n    「:goodwill:+1」\n\nDay 3\n\n\n    :transferStudent:\n    「:paranoia:-1」\n    :classRep:\n    「:goodwill:+2」\n    :richStudent:\n    「Move to City」\n\nDay 4\n\n\n    :journalist:\n    「:intrigue:Forbid」\n    :ai:\n    「:goodwill:+2」\n    :richStudent:\n    「Move to City」"

Let's start the next loop.",

We recommend that you keep your communication with the Protagonists to a minimum except for answering their questions, and leave your seat between Loops.\n\nWhen the Public Sheet is presented, the Protagonists may laugh at the limitations on the Mastermind, but they won't be laughing much longer.\n\nBasically, aim for :spreading: and :hospitalIncident: to occur, and for :immortal: to take effect by involving :godlyBeing:. Move :doctor: to City (preparing for :goodwill: and :paranoia: boost), and keep placing :paranoia: on :forensicSpecialist: and :boss:. Move :blackCat: to Hospital, and at the same time, place :intrigue: +2 on Hospital. \n\nAlthough the Protagonists will initially see this as a normal power play and try to thwart it, you should make full use of the abilities of the :conspiracyTheorist: and :cultist:.\n\nIn the unlikely event that :spreading: does occur, remove it from :richStudent: and place it on :doctor:, :godlyBeing:, or :forensicSpecialist:.\n\nIf you have extra hands, place Forbid :goodwill: on :richStudent: or move it to the City (so that you can use :forensicSpecialist: to remove it if :goodwill: is placed). The Protagonists will probably not understand your intentions, and a spiteful Protagonist who is used to the game will sneak through and place :paranoia: or :goodwill: on it, not realizing that they're tying their own noose.\n\nWhen the Culprit behind :butterflyEffect: and role of the :godlyBeing: are revealed, the Protagonists will feel the difficulty of breaking the loop, and the strange discomfort caused by the Mastermind's actions. Once they realize the true purpose behind everything, it's time for telepathic cooperation. Let's break out of this accursed Loop, together.\n\nTo break the loop, you need to do the following 4 things:\n\n- Cause a :hospitalIncident:\n\n- Move the :patient: out of the Hospital before the Incident occurs\n\n- Involve the :blackCat: in the :hospitalIncident:\n\n- Place 3 :goodwill: on :godlyBeing:\n\nThere are two routes: use :godlyBeing: to remove one :intrigue: from the Hospital, or use the :soldier: to make the Protagonists :immortal:.\n\nIf the role of :richStudent: is exposed due to the whims of the Protagonists, it will be more difficult to break through the Loop. In that case, on the first day, place a Vertical Movement on :doctor:, a Horizontal Movement on :richStudent:, and a :paranoia: +1 on :forensicSpecialist: or :boss: to support them.\n\nIn any case, if the Protagonists and Mastermind work together perfectly, at the end of the last day:\n\n- All characters except :blackCat: will survive and gather in the City\n- All :paranoia: counters will be zero\n- Everyone will have :goodwill: counters on them\n\nYou can do it.

You can come in tomorrow, right?\"\n\n\"ChatGPT can do a better job than this.\"\n\n\"Young people these days are so...\"\n\n\"Ah, I'll leave this to you then. Can you get it done in three days?\"\n\nI'm sick of this.\nLet's put an end to these monotonous days once and for all.\n\nDay 1: :increasingUnease: (:teacher:)\n\nMy workload increases, but my salary remains the same. This is serious, I'll spread the word on social media about this.\n\nDay 2: :murder: (:officeWorker:)\n\nI have no choice, he has to die. Deadlines? No, you should worry about your own deadline instead.\n\nDay 3: :hospitalIncident: (:nurse:)\n\nMedical equipment malfunction? Accidentally gave the wrong dosage? Well, it was an accident, what can you do about it?\n\nFinal Guess\n\nI've had enough! I'm going to tell the news station everything!",
      "mastermindHints": "Try your best to keep the :boss: alive.\n\nThe School is safe because it's far from the Hospital, and the :officeWorker: can't enter it. However, if the Protagonists notice the :threadsFate: and :paranoiaVirus: Sub Plots, it'll be very dangerous to make it out alive.\n\nIn the first Loop, if you use Forbid :goodwill: and Forbid :paranoia:, you should be safe. Interfere with their search for the Incident's Culprit, and pray that you don't get any :goodwill:. Never use the :conspiracyTheorist:'s mandatory ability.\n\nAfter the second Loop, the :serialKiller: will appear here and there, so avoid being alone with them. Also, if the :officeWorker: has hit his :paranoia: Limit, keep placing Movement cards on the :officeWorker: and the :boss:. Since there are only three Forbid Movement cards, you can avoid :murder: on the second Day.\n\nThe final Loop is pure hell, so brace yourself. If the Protagonists noticed :threadsFate: and the :paranoiaVirus: Sub Plots, they'll have scattered :goodwill: in the previous Loop. The Mastermind can only fight back with :paranoia:-1 and Forbid :paranoia:, but the Protagonists have plenty of :paranoia: and :intrigue: with three :paranoia:+1, and the mandatory abilities of the :journalist: and :doctor:. Grit your teeth and do your best to survive.\n\nFor the Final Guess, the :conspiracyTheorist: will be the focus, so try to hide her if you can afford it...\n\nI think the Mastermind's chances of winning are slim, so you might want to consider cutting out the Final Guess altogether."

      "mastermindHints": "The scriptwriter's means of victory are killing :sealedItem: and :friend:. However, since the use of :paranoiaVirus: is essential to killing :friend:, we will first aim to win with :sealedItem:.\n\nIn the case of CS axis, CS of the main plot is very important.\n\nPut :intrigue: on boards other than City and :alien: to expand the possibilities of the main plot. For that, incidents are a strong support. Since you want to cause all incidents while concealing the culprit, scatter :paranoia: with all your might. You can also use :conspiracyTheorist: from the beginning. Be careful of the movement of the :policeOfficer: so that you do not narrow down the culprit of :foulEvil:.\n\nIn the case of PP axis, use :cultist: to win the first loop. If you pass :intrigue: to Shrine, it is better not to cause :foulEvil:. The first loop is very stable, but since you want to hide the :cultist: until the final battle, you need to move in such a way that the :alien:'s :goodwill: ability is never used. Use Forbid :goodwill: at full power, but be careful of :richStudent: and :forensicSpecialist:'s :goodwill: abilities.\n\nAs the game progresses, it becomes more difficult to win with :sealedItem:. Then it's time to use :paranoiaVirus:.\n\nOn the final day, leave the :person: and :friend: alone and aim for a surprise attack by turning them into a :serialKiller: with :increasingUnease:. If the person has one :paranoia: counter on them, they can be a candidate, so it is important to spread :paranoia:.\n\nIn the final battle, hide the :cultist:. It is a role that is difficult to find, but it may be revealed by :nurse:'s trait, :paranoiaVirus:, :forensicSpecialist:, etc."
