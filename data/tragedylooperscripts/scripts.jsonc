Keep killing the nurse if you can, or try a steady win via Hospital Incident. It's up to you. 3rd loop is a battle of wits. If you succeed, you may still lose at The Final Guess unless you managed to hide the Witch so be careful.\nThe Cultist is your best friend. Beware, the Protagonists will try to kill him with the Serial Killer. If you can, try to keep the journalist's role concelead at least for the first loop; that will make your plays a lot easier.

Then win via patient shenanigans, but use :intrigue: cards and missing person to bluff giant time bomb, sealed item, and/or sign with me\n2. use increasing unease to set off either the loved one, spreading, or butterfly effect, depending on what you need. spreading is good because you can remove :goodwill: from the time traveler (great). loved one is obviously insanely good. and butterfly effect sometimes needs that little extra push.\n3. try to kill the girlStudent (lover) before the RMD (friend). then you can autowin with the officeWorker's ability without showing the friend first. This doesn't apply if they already :goodwill:ed OW of course.\n4. bluff that the informer, cop, and patient are all cultists. you can lock your protags out of this info until they start pressuring you actively by threatening to win. remember you can use spreading to help deny this info as well. they should be strapped for :goodwill: between all the crazy abilities that are on the loose (doc, alien, OW, mboy, these two). Anyways, this is your final guess mainstay.\n5. don't forget to move the doctor out of the hospital. if you aggressively move him orthogonally to the hospital it's absolutely impossible for them to get him back inside. ideally you do this day 1 of later loops, then they're forced to use his 3-cost ability to deal with butterfly effect. You should basically always do this for the first two loops.\n6. use doctor aggressively if you need to, to obfuscate the serial killer. if you can hide SK for 2 loops you're really set\n7. the officeWorker and alien's movement restrictions make him a lot harder to kill. it takes a pretty huge amount of card investment to actually use his ability, and you typically can't do so while keeping the contheorist hidden either.\n8. Missing person can allow you to add :intrigue: to locations (useful for bluffing), kill the RMD (another wincon), and prevent the protagonists from figuring out the time traveler with the serial killer.\n9. the most important thing you can do is hide the alien-SK from them for as long as possible.\n10. That said, if the SK dies and the mysteryBoy is already gone, you're in kind of an awkward position. So prioritize saving the mysteryBoy in later loops.",

Loved one kills protagonists.\n\nThis script was inspired by the doctor's 3-cost :goodwill: ability. How could I make it crucial for the protagonists? This motivated doctor as time traveler and alien as serial killer, and patient doing butterfly effect. I then added the other stuff. It's a bit overkill honestly. Here are all the gimmicks in this script:\n\ngimmicks:\n1. the patient needs to leave the hospital in order to stop BFE\n2. spreading can ruin the doctor and motivate an alternate wincon\n3. the serial killer suicides early, making it difficult to pick out roles\n4. mboy is contheorist, leaking both subplots but making for a vicious contender\n5. officeWorker as loved one unfucks the role\n6. missing person works to cause or interrupt serial kills, and to facilitate bluffing loop 1\n\nThe one time I tested this, I was running the following changes: informer instead of boss, informer does hospital incident instead of foul evil. I'm thinking of switching the girlStudent and officeWorker too, but I'm not sure if that's too imbalanced.\n\nThe lesson of this script for me is that I may have tried to cram too many tricks and gimmicks in. Maybe it's better to write scripts with \"theses\" if that makes sense. Very tightly focused explorations of a concept. That's not what this is lol. Good luck.\n    boyStudent",

You do have some tools at your disposal, however.\n-The informer and officeWorker are good early game bait for the Protagonists to waste time on. Use them either as decoys or false leads as you play it out.\n-Be aggressive in using the abilities at your disposal in the beginning. Incidents are very important in this script, particularly on the first day. Use the combined abilities of your cards, the Conspiracy Theorist, and the Curmudgeon doctor to stack up :paranoia: and keep the Protagonists guessing as to the culprits of the incidents.\n-Between placing 2 :intrigue: on the School and placing 2 :intrigue: on the girlStudent (Friend), the Cultist's presence will quickly become apparent, which you can use to your advantage when covering up the main plot. However, if the Protagonists discover that the mysteryBoy is the Cultist, it will destroy all cover-ups related to A Place to Protect. Be prepared for this.\n-Once the godlyBeing arrives in Loop 3, how you want to use it will depend on how close the Protagonists are to figuring your Plots out. If they are near certain as to what they are, go loud with its Brain ability. You should be able to secure the win and prepare for the battle that is the last loop. Alternatively, if they are still unsure, use it only to secure the win, and preferably when there's room to deceive.

There are also 3 potentially useful :goodwill: 2 abilities, and none of them have :goodwill: Refusal, so expect these to be used to full effect, on top of the Friend (officeWorker) potentially being revealed before you can win using them. Finally, it is highly likely that the main plot will be discovered quickly, so you must take every opportunity to conceal the identities of your Key Person (nurse) and Killer (popIdol) during every loop but the last. Your most common route to victory early on will involve the Hospital Incident, using the Conspiracy Theorist as the culprit and your cards, you can easily pull off 2 :paranoia: on the patient. Between killing the Friend via the Murder incident and a :intrigue: turbo combo (Day 1: +2 :intrigue: on Killer, then +1 :intrigue: from Brain), you also have a couple of backup plans in case things go awry. If the Protagonists' strategy relies on a specific :goodwill: ability (notably the nurse or classRep), you can have the henchman steal 2 :goodwill: from that character using the Spreading incident, placing it on a useless :goodwill: ability (as his incident has already triggered).",

This script is as much chaos for the Mastermind as it is for the Protagonists. You should aim to get the Friend killed on Loop 1 and 2 (Special Rule and Faraway Murder), and try to save the Key Person's death and the A Place to Protect loss condition for the last two loops. Be very aware of how the board will change with the moving Shrine, and be especially careful of movement restrictions on certain characters. One way to quickly kill someone is to place +2 :intrigue: on someone and then send them to the Shrine, but the Protagonists will not fall for this twice. It is possible for the Protagonists to exploit the Special Rule on Day 2 to gain more :goodwill: on specific characters, so be prepared to counter this. With so much potential :paranoia: on the board, it can be fairly easy to cover up the culprits of Incidents in the first couple of loops. On the final loop, aim to trigger Missing Person and move the shrineMaiden to the School, and take advantage of the age old catch 22: +1 :intrigue: on the School, or +2 somewhere worse. The key to victory here is to take advantage of how much you can bamboozle the Protagonists with an ever-shifting board and a terrifying amount of :paranoia: and :intrigue: generation.",

It might be tempting to have the mysteryBoy (Key Person) killed by the illusion (Serial Killer) for a quick loop end, however it will reveal the main plot and the role of a wildcard character, so it is best saved for the last loop. One potential early strategy is to move another character into the Shrine and then pump it with :intrigue: via the Brain and your cards, to hide both the Brain and the Serial Killer while guaranteeing an early loop win. You should save Incidents for Loop 2, with Missing Person able to add 1 :intrigue: to the Shrine, and both the Suicide and Murder able to kill the Key Person as a last resort. You should try to get the doctor killed if you can, as his :goodwill: ability will either force you to block it every turn, or render the patient's Conspiracy Theorist ability useless.",

Meanwhile in the School, a youngGirl has lost her plushie and two of her seniors have stayed till the break of dusk to try and help her. The classRepresentative is however becoming uneasy, feeling a set of human eyes peer through the windows, every now and again; she starts becoming paranoid. Curses, curses and curses. The Shrine's curse! The girl cackles, an infatuated grin forms on her face as :paranoia: takes ahold of her body. Bloodshed was all she could see. Eyes peer from the horizon, the empty sky; a God looks down upon the Shrine and smiles, for the true source of power shall remain hidden.

Try not to fall into a trap.\n\nIf the Protagonists ignore the youngGirl, then you have two choices: \n\nMove the boyStudent & classRep out, and move the doctor to the School; revealing your Serial Killer.\nOR\nTrigger Butterfly Effect, and transform the classRep into a Serial Killer by pushing hard for :paranoia:.\n\nIf the youngGirl is not ignored, you are effectively forced to play Forbid :goodwill: on her lest you want an early game over.\n-\nFrom there on out, your goal is to make sure to kill the Friend every single loop, which will become detrimentally harder during Loop 2, onwards. However, you still have the cover up stories of 'Change of Future' and 'Giant Time Bomb' at this stage; so if you cannot kill the youngGirl, push for :intrigue: by moving Cultist to the Shrine.\n\nYou should have won here, but now; the Protagonists should know that it cannot be Giant Time Bomb. \n\nNow, Protagonists will start focusing on trying to find the Time Traveler; so expect heavy :goodwill: pushes during Loop 3, also using the Serial Killer (If found). Thankfully, you have a new card to play with; The 'godlyBeing' who triggers Foul Evil. \n\nA word of warning, if you do trigger this incident successfully, the Protagonists will almost certainly deduce that it's The Sealed Item, and by this point will have known for certainty that 'A Hidden Freak' is in play, and depending on skill and playstyles; Paranoia Virus too.\n\nThe 4th Loop is all about trying to win without revealing who the brain is.

You see something disturbing in the strands of time. A Suicide… some Foul Evil brewing… and an innocuous action that causes Butterfly Effect all appear to lead up to a horrific tragedy. You detect the manipulation of the Mastermind at work and decide to investigate.\n    Alan Tran\n\nIf Loop One Fails: \nAll of a sudden you are thrown back into the time stream. You have failed but it happened so suddenly that you don’t know how it happened or what caused it. You hear the arrogant laughter of the Mastermind echoing through the time stream. You loop back to investigate.\n\n    Alan Tran\n\nIf Loop Two Fails: \nTentacle monster burse forth from the Shrine. They pour over the City, squeezing all the characters into jelly. The screams of the populace are forever etched into your psyche. The time stream becomes dark and think as the Mastermind attempts to lock in this reality. You manage to loop back for a final attempt at saving the City.\n    Alan Tran\n\nIf Loop Three Fails: \nA bright light, brighter than the sun, appears at the Shrine and Tentacle monster burse forth. To your horror, you see that there are people chanting around the Tentacle portal. Some there are people in this Tentacle Cult that are summoning the monsters. Due to the bright light you can’t make out the features of their faces but it must be characters that you have come into contact with in this Tentacle cult. A huge tentacle monster slithers toward you. The time stream becomes dark and think as the Mastermind attempts to lock in this reality. As the tentacle reaches for your leg you manage to loop back for a final attempt at saving the City.\n    Alan Tran\n\nIf the Protagonists Fail Loop Four: \nThe city is in ruins. Tentacle monsters everywhere! The mangled bodies of the populace cause your stomach to retch. The time stream is opaque and feels like a tub of molasses. You can’t escape this reality. Tentacle monsters are all around you, suckers extending for you face. Your only chance is to shatter the foundation of the time stream that the Mastermind has created. If you can perfectly deduce his plots, then you might be able to shatter this reality and get the threads of time flowing again.

The Mastermind used the journalist as the Brain behind his evil scheme. The policeOfficer harbored a dark hatred of the students at the school and joined the tentacle monster cabal as a Cultist to unleash horrors upon them. The shame of this dark desire put thoughts of Suicide into the policeOfficer’s head. \n\nThe doctor was an unwitting pawn of the cabal as they used him to spread Foul Evil through his legitimate medical practice by tainting his instruments of healing with demonic curses.\n\nThe three girls that foiled the plot, with inspiration from the Protagonists, were two students and the local shrineMaiden. The shrineMaiden led the group. She had a reputation for being a nutty Conspiracy Theorist before this incident. You wonder what led enabled this child to take down the tentacle cult. Was it the simple of a child that led to Butterfly Effect the Mastermind couldn’t predict or just her unbridled raw :paranoia: that ultimately took down the tentacle cult? It impossible to know for sure.\n\nAs your reenter the time stream you sense the presence of the Mastermind retreating upon your arrival. Gone is arrogance you have always sensed from the Mastermind entity.

The shrineMaiden led the group. She was viewed as bright Conspiracy Theorist before this incident, but her :paranoia: and the randomness of a Butterfly Effect ultimately were not enough to stop the tentacle cult. However, the where they failed, you have succeeded.\n\nWith a boom heard through the City, the static black threads of the Mastermind’s time stream break into chunks and are washed away. The horrible reality is annihilated and the healthy crystalline-blue time stream resumes flowing. You are free and back in the time stream. The Mastermind’s presence is nowhere to be seen. He has escaped. You wonder how many times you will be able to survive these close calls with death.\n    Alan Tran\n\nIf the Leader Fails on the Final Guess: \nThe Mastermind’s plots prove too difficult to untangle. The tentacle monsters envelope you. To your horror, you realize that they are not trying to squeeze you into jelly, only take you prisoner. You are taken to the school where to face the surviving members of the cult. The cult had many members from the City and was run by the journalist (the Brain). The policeOfficer harbored a dark hatred of the students at the school and joined the tentacle monster cabal as a Cultist to unleash horrors upon them. The shame of this dark desire put thoughts of Suicide into the policeOfficer’s head. \n\nOver the days of torture you piece together that the doctor was an unwitting pawn of the cabal as they used him to spread Foul Evil through his legitimate medical practice by tainting his instruments of healing with demonic curses.\n\nThe three girls that tried and failed to foil the plot were two students and the local shrineMaiden. The Shield Maiden led the group. She was viewed as a bright Conspiracy Theorist before this incident, but her :paranoia: and the randomness of a Butterfly Effect ultimately were not enough to stop the tentacle cult. \n\nOne by one you see the innocent charters tortured and killed by tentacle monsters for the entertainment of the cabal. The time streams are so dark you can barely perceive their existence. Did they ever exist at all or have you always existed in this world of pain and tentacles. There is no escape. The only question left is whether your mind or body will be first to break beyond repair. You know now that will be up to the Mastermind. He will is makes your reality.\n    Alan Tran",

So, you can get the girlStudent to :paranoia: Limit by Day 4 easily, and also have the Rich Man’s Daughter either trigger her incident on Day 2 or use her Mastermind ability to put :intrigue: on the school: the protagonists can't both play a :paranoia: -1 on her and move her out of the School on Day 1.

      "story": "Story: Dr. Isha was a normal doctor by day, but by night he was something more sinister. As the leader of a nefarious cult, he had finally completed their evil rituals and trapped a young patient of his in an inescapable time loop. // \n\nJimmy Kanja had had a weak constitution since he was young and could rarely attend school. His only friends were nurse Kangofu and his childhood bestie Danshi Gakusei. One day, after a routine check-up, he was told he wasn't allowed to leave. Strange men in robes performed a strange ritual on him and confined him to the hospital. A few days later, on the eve of his planned escape, he found his work undone, and the calendar reset. Four days later, it happened again. He was able to confirm: he was living the same four days, over and over again. // \n\nRepeating the same days, over and over again, confined to the same building, Jimmy's sanity slipped. Where once he saw friends, he later saw only enemies, until finally he couldn't even remember who they were. He would lash out if anyone showed him the slightest signs of kindness, often brutally. And the ritual's effects distorted causality, causing the surrounding town's inhabitants to have hideously altered memories of previous cycles. His friends were hit the hardest: their guilt over being unable to help Jimmy and their fear over his increasingly erratic behavior compounded from loop to loop, until they would try to kill themselves whenever Jimmy recognized them. Of course, this process was helped along by Dr. Isha's daughter, Ojou Isha. // \n\nThe protagonists manage to weaken the effects of the ritual and enter the time loop. However, to fully end it, they need Jimmy to willingly want it to end. That means they'll have to bring him back to sanity. But if he finds out his friends have killed themselves, or worse, that he's done the deed himself, he'll slip back farther than ever... // \n\nAlso, there's a murdering shrineMaiden, and a Hospital Incidenting girlStudent. They don't really fit into the plot.",

      "mastermindHints": "The secret rule is that you must play :intrigue: +1 or :intrigue: +2 on the Hospitalk during your first day's plays.\n\nYour goal, obviously, is to set up the \"Friend revealed -> :goodwill: placement -> 2 :paranoia:\" loop on as many friends as possible, so as to make their suicides a running thing. Unless you get some unwitting help from the Protagonists, you probably won't be able to have the friends commit suicide on Loop 2; you can get around this with the Time Traveller loss condition, or by having the shrineMaiden murder a friend (if she received :goodwill: on an earlier loop). The Protagonists' goal is to either use the nurse, girlStudent, and popIdol abilities to reduce the Friends below :paranoia: limit, or to have the shrineMaiden sniff out the Time Traveller. The shrineMaiden can do this by checking the patient with her 5 :goodwill: ability (or all other candidates, by process of elimination); by having the Hospital Incident reveal the Timend Traveller; or possibly by having just the shrineMaiden and patient in the Hospital after Day 1, forcing the shrineMaiden to attempt to murder the Immortal patient; be on guard for all three. You can try feinting Sealed Item by occasionally trying to get :intrigue: on the Shrine in the early parts of the game, so that if they uncover that the doctor is a Cultist, they'll guess the wrong Plot; however, if you're forced to use the Time Traveller loss condition, they'll know right away which Plot they have. Otherwise, victory will mainly come from good play, by keeping the shrineMaiden from finding out too much information and by keeping at least one friend dying every loop.",
