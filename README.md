is a scenario-based deduction board game where players take the roles of time
loopers attempting to prevent a tragedy.

Its Fun :)

## So What's this?

This is the code for the website https://lokimidgard.github.io/tragedy-looper-deduction-tool/.

It is a tool that generates script specific deduction matrix for the specific
characters and a checklist for the Mastermind.

It has all premade Scripts of the Z-Man version of the Base Game, Midnight
Circle and Cosmic Evil, pre entered and ready to go. But you can of course made
your own Scripts.

It will safe your custom scripts locally in your Browser, and you can ex-/import
them to text. You can also share the script with others.
